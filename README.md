# Git 'Er Done

A self-destructing to-do list that expires tasks after a certain amount of time. Enter a new task and mark it as completed to move it into a separate (History) view. Expired tasks will also display in History, when removed from the Active tasks view.

## Setup

1. clone the repository
2. npm install
3. start server (npm start)

## Firebase

This app already ships connected to my free tier Firebase Service. If you want to setup a separate host for this, get a free [Firebase Acnt](https://firebase.google.com), then switch out your code in index.html.
